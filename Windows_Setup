This will be a breakdown of how to set up your vulnerable Windows Instance for AWS Pentesting Practice. 

NOTE: You may only interact with your virtual instances. You cannot target other users instances or the AWS infrastructure. When in doubt contact AWS Support for more information.

Users should have an AWS account. This environment with be mostly free minus some charges AWS may make on your debit card. They refer to this as a "HOLD" that will be reimbursed as a discount on your monthly invoice. I recommend getting a Prepaid Debit card and put maybe $5 on it and add that as your form of payment.

Windows Setup:
Once in your AWS environment there will be a small section in the top left of the page that says "Services". Click this and select "Compute", then "EC2".
You will be redirected to a new page that will have a list of options, here you will select "Instances" and you will be redirected.
Here you will select Launch Instance in the upper right hand corner or in the center of the page.
You will be redirected to a new page to build out the instance. Here you can name the instance, select the image (Which will be Kali Linux), Instance Type, etc.
You will have to search for this particular image "Windows Server 2012 R2" and it should be the first one. 
Once you select it, you will have to make modifications in order maintain a free instance. This can be done in Instance Type.
Develop a key pair.
Maintain Default values, except VPC, Subnet, and Security Group. Select the Subnet, VPC ID, and Security Group that is assigned to your other machines.
Ensure that the Security Group has an inbound rule to allow RDP connection,
And you can Launch the instance.
