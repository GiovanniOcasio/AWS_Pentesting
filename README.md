# AWS_Pentesting

This repository will be contain all the setup instructions, methodology, and notes on Penetration Testing in an AWS environment. I am by no means an expert, I just post what I learn in hopes to help others looking to break into cyber security and pentesting.
I will discuss set up a vulnerable Ubuntu and Windows machine, as well as a Kali Linux machine in AWS. I will also discuss methodolgy, tools, etc. that I have learned, along with any individual notes I may take along the way.

Book I used: Hands-On AWS Penetration Testing with Kali Linux by Karl Gilbert & Benjamin Caudill
