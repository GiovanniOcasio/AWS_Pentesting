# AWS_Pentesting
This repository will contain notes, tools, and methodologies for penetration testing within an Amazon Web Services environment. To initially set up the CloudGoat Environment I followed Tyler Ramsbey's setup video on YouTube. Also you can find the requirements for the CloudGoat setup in the CloudGoat GitHub. Another way to develop AWS Pentesting skills is through the use of flAWS.cloud, a free resource to practice AWS Pentesting Skills.
