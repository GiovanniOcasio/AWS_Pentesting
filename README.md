# AWS_Pentesting
This repository will contain notes, tools, and methodologies for penetration testing within an Amazon Web Services environment. To initially set up the CloudGoat Environment I followed Tyler Ramsbey's setup video on YouTube. Also you can find the requirements for the CloudGoat setup in the CloudGoat GitHub.
