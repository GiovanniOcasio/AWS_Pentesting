# AWS_Pentesting

I apologize for the delay but due to inconsistencies with previous material I was unable to complete my previous repository so I will be starting from scratch with the TryHackMe Rooms available.

This repository will be contain all the setup instructions, methodology, and notes on Penetration Testing in an AWS environment. I am by no means an expert, I just post what I learn in hopes to help others looking to break into cyber security and pentesting.
I will discuss set up a vulnerable Ubuntu and Windows machine, as well as a Kali Linux machine in AWS. I will also discuss methodolgy, tools, etc. that I have learned, along with any individual notes I may take along the way.
