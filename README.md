# AWS_Pentesting
This repository will contain notes, tools, and methodologies for penetration testing within an Amazon Web Services environment. To initially set up the CloudGoat Environment I followed Tyler Ramsbey's setup video on YouTube. Also you can find the requirements for the CloudGoat setup in the CloudGoat GitHub. Another way to develop AWS Pentesting skills is through the use of flAWS.cloud, a free resource to practice AWS Pentesting Skills.

flAWS.cloud is a site that is publicly available for individuals to test AWS S3 Buckets. It allows users to develop their testing methodology, and provides useful hints for beginners getting stuck. I will include my write up on my walkthrough of the environment.
